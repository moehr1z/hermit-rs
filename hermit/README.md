This crate builds and links against the [Hermit kernel](https://github.com/hermit-os/kernel) to create a Hermit unikernel image.

## Building

1.  Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [target.'cfg(target_os = "hermit")'.dependencies]
    hermit = "0.6"
    ```

2.  Add the following to your `main.rs`:

    ```rust
    #[cfg(target_os = "hermit")]
    use hermit as _;
    ```

3.  Build against one of the [`*-unknown-hermit`] targets.

    [`*-unknown-hermit`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support/hermit.html

    Either

    -   install [rust-std-hermit] on stable Rust

        [rust-std-hermit]: https://github.com/hermit-os/rust-std-hermit

    or

    -   use `-Zbuild-std=std,panic_abort` on nightly Rust.

## Running

You can boot the resulting image in the specialized [Uhyve] unikernel hypervisor or on other platforms like QEMU using the [Hermit loader].
